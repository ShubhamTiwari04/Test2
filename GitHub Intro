What is GitHub?
GitHub is a web-based platform built on top of Git, providing hosting for software development version control using Git. 
It offers collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

Key Concepts:

Sure, here are the key concepts explained in simple terms:

1. Repository (Repo):
   - Think of a repository like a big folder where you keep all your project's stuff.
   - In GitHub, it's like a central storage space online where you put all the files and folders for your project.
   - It also keeps track of all the changes you make to those files over time.

2. Issue:
   - An issue is like a sticky note where you write down anything related to your project that needs attention.
   - It could be an idea for improvement, a problem you've found, or just something you want to talk about.
   - Anyone can write an issue, and then you can assign it to specific people to deal with.

3. Pull Request (PR):
   - A pull request is like asking someone to check out your work and give feedback before you officially add it to your project.
   - It's a way for people to suggest changes or improvements to the project.
   - Others can review the changes, discuss them, and decide whether to include them or not.

4. Branch Protection:
   - Branch protection is like putting a lock on certain parts of your project to make sure nothing goes wrong.
   - It allows you to set rules like requiring someone else to check your work before you add it to the main part of the project.
   - This helps keep the project safe and working smoothly.

5. Fork:
   - Forking a repository is like making a copy of someone else's project to play around with.
   - It's like taking a recipe and making your version of it without changing the original.
   - You can experiment with changes in your own copy without affecting the original project.

6. Collaborators:
   - Collaborators are like team members who have access to work on a project together.
   - They're people who can contribute directly to the project by making changes or adding new stuff.
   - It's a way for multiple people to work together on the same project.
